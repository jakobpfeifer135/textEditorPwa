- What was your motivation?
to learn how i can use service workers and keep data for users not only while online but also keeping that data when they're offline.

to show how data can be stored by a user without being online and have that data for them whenever they come back as well!

- What problem does it solve?
allows a person to keep track of their important notes with ease and allow them to install my app locally!
- What did you learn?
i learned so much about keeping user data ready for them no matter their circumstance so they use my applications regardless of internet connection.
